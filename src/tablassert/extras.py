"""Optional-extra registry: which extra ships which package, and how to install it.

Tablassert's base install builds knowledge graphs from CSV/TSV sources. QC, the
autonomous agent, and GEPA prompt optimization are OPTIONAL extras, so a user can
reach a code path whose dependencies were never installed. When that happens the
failure must name the extra and the exact install command — never a bare
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'`` raised hours into a build.

This module is the single source of truth for that mapping. Two entry points:

- :func:`require` is a PREFLIGHT check. It probes with ``importlib.util.find_spec``
  (which does not execute the module, so it costs nothing) and is called at the CLI
  boundary, before any expensive work starts.
- :func:`require_module` is the LATE check for a lazy import that has already been
  reached, used by :mod:`tablassert.agent` and :class:`tablassert._lazy.LazyModule`.
