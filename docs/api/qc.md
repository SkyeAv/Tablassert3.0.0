# Quality Control (qc)

The `qc` module validates entity-resolution mappings through a four-stage pipeline (exact, fuzzy, abbreviation expansion, SapBERT semantic similarity) — it runs behind `build-kg --qc` and `resolve_many(qc=True)` to keep only high-confidence assertions.

QC runtime support is optional. Install `tablassert[qc]` to enable it — the extra pulls `scikit-learn` and `sentence-transformers` (`torch` and `numpy` arrive transitively); `rapidfuzz` is a core dependency and is always available.

`fullmap_audit()` checks the whole extra before it does any work and raises `QcRuntimeMissingError` naming every absent package and the install command. Checking up front matters because the two packages are needed at different stages — `scikit-learn` from the start, `sentence-transformers` only if Stage 4 is reached — so a half-installed extra would otherwise fail after the audit had already run. `build-kg --qc` performs the same check before the build begins, since the audit does not run until the very end of the build.

## fullmap_audit()

Primary quality control function that filters entity mappings based on confidence criteria.

### Function Signature

```python
def fullmap_audit(
  lf: pl.LazyFrame,
  col: str,
  section_hash: str,
  config_file: str,
  out: str = "passed",
  log: bool = True,
) -> pl.LazyFrame
```

### Parameters

**`lf: pl.LazyFrame`**

Input LazyFrame containing entity resolution results.

Expected columns:
- `{col}_pre_resolution` - Original (pre-resolution) text string
- `{col}` - Resolved CURIE
- `{col}_name` - Preferred entity name

**`col: str`**

Base column name for entity resolution.

Example: If `col="subject"`, looks for:
- `"subject_pre_resolution"`
- `"subject"`
- `"subject_name"`

**`out: str` (default: `"passed"`)**

Name of the boolean column indicating validation status (used internally).

Rows with `out=True` passed QC, `out=False` failed.

**`log: bool` (default: `True`)**

Controls whether failed QC rows are logged.

**`section_hash: str` / `config_file: str`**

Context fields used in QC failure logs for traceability.

### Return Value

Returns a Polars LazyFrame containing only the rows whose `col` value (CURIE) has **at least one** passing pre-resolution/preferred-name pair.

QC scores unique `(CURIE, pre_resolution, preferred_name)` pairs, but the result is joined back to the input via a **semi-join on the CURIE column** (`df.join(passed.select(col), on=col, how="semi")`). The retention granularity is therefore the CURIE, not the individual pair: if *any* pair for a CURIE passes any stage, *every* input row sharing that CURIE is kept — including rows that were themselves part of a failed pair. A CURIE (and thus all of its rows) is dropped only when *none* of its pairs pass any stage. Failed pairs are logged with section/config/column context and their fuzzy/SapBERT scores.

### Four-Stage Pipeline

The function applies four validation stages in sequence. Each stage progressively filters out correct resolutions and leaves suspected errors for the next stage.

#### Stage 1: Exact Match & Rule-Based Pass-Through

**Fast path for high-confidence mappings.** A row passes if any of these hold:

```python
original == preferred_name
```

- The pre-resolution text exactly equals the resolved preferred name.
- The resolved CURIE matches an exempt prefix (`CHEBI`, `PR`, `UniProtKB`, `NCBIGene`, `UMLS`, `UNII`, `PUBCHEM`, `MONDO`).
- The original text contains `:` (already looks like a CURIE).
- The preferred name matches an exception prefix (`^LOC` or `^si:`).

**Performance:** O(1) string comparison per row.

#### Stage 2: Fuzzy Matching

**Medium confidence using RapidFuzz (batched via `rapidfuzz.process.cpdist`).**

Two fuzzy matching algorithms:
1. **Ratio:** Overall string similarity
2. **Partial token sort ratio:** Combined token/subsequence matching

**Thresholds:** `fuzz.ratio` >= 70 OR `fuzz.partial_token_sort_ratio` >= 80

```python
fuzz.ratio(original, preferred) >= 70
or fuzz.partial_token_sort_ratio(original, preferred) >= 80
```

**Performance:** O(n) string operations, batched.

#### Stage 3: Abbreviation Expansion

**Deterministic pass for abbreviation/expansion pairs (Schwartz-Hearst).** A row passes when the pre-resolution text abbreviates the preferred name, or vice versa:

```python
_is_abbrev(original, preferred_name) or _is_abbrev(preferred_name, original)
```

The matcher scans the short form right-to-left against the long form (case-insensitively); the first character of the short form must land on a word boundary of the long form. This rescues the class both fuzzy matching and embedding similarity can miss — `AML` ↔ `acute myeloid leukemia`.

**Performance:** O(n) character scans per row, no model inference.

#### Stage 4: SapBERT Semantic Similarity

**High confidence using SapBERT embeddings.**

1. **Encode** original and preferred name with SapBERT (sentence-transformers)
2. **Compute** cosine similarity between embeddings (scikit-learn)
3. **Accept** if similarity >= 0.5

```python
embeddings = get_sapbert().encode(originals + preferreds)
similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[:n], embeddings[n:]).diagonal()
return similarity >= qc.SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD  # 0.5
```

**Performance:** Expensive (transformer inference); the model is loaded once and cached.

### SapBERT Model

**Model:** `cambridgeltl/SapBERT-from-PubMedBERT-fulltext`

**Backend:** [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) (PyTorch). Embeddings are compared with scikit-learn's `cosine_similarity`. SapBERT's self-alignment pretraining pulls UMLS synonym pairs together in embedding space, which fits this stage's task — deciding whether two names denote the same entity — better than the NLI/STS-trained BioBERT it replaced. The 0.5 threshold was carried over from that BioBERT gate and has not been re-tuned for SapBERT's score distribution.

**Lazy-loaded** on the first `fullmap_audit()` call that reaches the embedding stage via `get_sapbert()`, then cached globally for the lifetime of the process.

### Model Caching

`get_sapbert()` loads the model from the local cache when present; otherwise it downloads `cambridgeltl/SapBERT-from-PubMedBERT-fulltext` and saves it for future runs.

**Cache location:** `.tablassert/sapbert/` on disk (`qc.MODEL`); the loaded model object is also cached in memory for the lifetime of the process.

### Example Usage

```python
from tablassert.qc import fullmap_audit
import polars as pl

# LazyFrame with entity resolution results
lf = pl.scan_parquet("resolved.parquet")

# Expected columns:
# - subject_pre_resolution
# - subject (CURIE)
# - subject_name

# Run QC
validated = fullmap_audit(
  lf,
  col="subject",
  section_hash="tutorial-section",
  config_file="tutorial-table.yaml",
)

# Only rows that passed QC remain
# Rows with low-confidence mappings removed
```

### Pipeline Flow

```
Input: 1000 rows with entity mappings

Stage 1 (Exact): 700 pass → 300 pending
Stage 2 (Fuzzy): 250 pass → 50 pending
Stage 3 (Abbreviation): 10 pass → 40 pending
Stage 4 (SapBERT): 30 pass → 10 rejected

Output: 990 rows (700 + 250 + 10 + 30)
```

### Confidence Levels

| Stage | Method | Confidence | Use Case |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Exact match / rule-based | Highest | Standardized IDs, acronyms, CURIE-like inputs |
| 2 | Fuzzy | Medium | Typos, word reordering |
| 3 | Abbreviation expansion | High | Abbreviation ↔ full-name pairs |
| 4 | SapBERT | High | Synonyms, paraphrases |

### Rejection Logging

When `log=True`, each rejected CURIE is logged at INFO level with its context and the scores that caused the rejection: `curie`, `original`, `preferred`, `col`, `fuzz` (partial token sort ratio), `config`, `hash`, and — when the SapBERT stage ran — `sapbert` (cosine similarity).

### Integration with Pipeline

QC is applied after entity resolution when QC is enabled (the `build-kg --qc` flag, or `resolve_many(..., qc=True)`):

1. **Entity resolution** (`resolve()`) - Maps text to CURIEs
2. **Quality control** (`fullmap_audit()`) - Validates mappings
3. **Export** - Only validated mappings in final output

This ensures knowledge graphs contain only high-confidence assertions.
