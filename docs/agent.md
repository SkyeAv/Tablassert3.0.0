# Autonomous Agent (`[agent]` extra)

**Why this exists:** hand-authoring a Tablassert config for every PMC supplementary table does not scale.
The optional `[agent]` extra makes it autonomous: point it at **PubMed Central (PMC)** article IDs and it
**derives the config for you**, then builds, audits, and iteratively improves the graph until the entity
resolution *maps* (coverage threshold). The outcome is an **NCATS Translator-compliant KGX knowledge
graph** per article, a claim the loop verifies rather than asserts, by constructing every emitted
record as its own Biolink class (see [Biolink validity](#biolink-validity)), with the whole loop
scored on **quality / cost / wrong tool calls**.

Under the hood it is built on [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) `CodeAgent` (a
ReAct loop) and [DSPy](https://dspy.ai) GEPA for prompt optimization.

!!! warning "Optional extra"
    The base `tablassert` package does **not** require any of this. `smolagents` and `dspy` are imported
    **lazily** in `tablassert.agent`, so the base install and its test suite are unaffected. Install the
    extra with `pip install "tablassert[agent]"`. GEPA prompt optimization (`--optimize`) additionally needs
    the `[optimize]` extra (`dspy`): `pip install "tablassert[optimize]"`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install "tablassert[agent]"

# GEPA prompt optimization (--optimize) additionally needs dspy:
pip install "tablassert[agent,optimize]"
```

| Package | Version | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `smolagents` | `==1.26.0` | `CodeAgent` ReAct loop, `OpenAIModel`/`LiteLLMModel`, tools |
| `litellm` | (any) | optional fallback / rate-limiting model backend |

| `dspy` | `==3.2.1` | `dspy.GEPA` black-box prompt optimization |

## PMC-AWS data source

Tables are fetched from the **new** PMC open-access S3 bucket, the sanctioned bulk path.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Bucket** | `s3://pmc-oa-opendata` (us-east-1) |
| **Access** | world-readable, **free**, no credentials (`--no-sign-request`); *not* requester-pays |
| **Download** | public HTTPS `https://pmc-oa-opendata.s3.amazonaws.com/<prefix>/<file>` |
| **Layout** | one prefix per article-version, e.g. `PMC11708054.1/`, containing `PMC<n>.<v>.xml` (JATS), `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.json` (metadata) and the media/supplementary files |

`fetch_pmc_article(pmc_id, outdir)` downloads the **useful** payload for the **latest** article version,
failing fast (cheap checks before any large download and before any model call):

1. Enumerates version prefixes via S3 `list-objects-v2` (`?list-type=2&prefix=PMC<n>.&delimiter=/`) and
   selects the **latest** version (numeric, so `PMC<n>.10` beats `PMC<n>.2`); older versions are ignored.
2. Checks the latest version's `.json` metadata for open access (`is_pmc_openaccess` / a `CC*`
   `license_code`), **before** any large download (not open access ⇒ `PermissionError` immediately).
3. Enumerates the version's objects (`?list-type=2&prefix=PMC<n>.<v>/`) and confirms a data table is
   present (a file with extension `.xlsx .xls .csv .tsv`), **before** any large download (none ⇒
   `FileNotFoundError`).
4. Downloads only the **useful** files to `outdir/<prefix>/<file>` and returns their paths: the main text
   (`.xml`/`.nxml`/`.txt`), the `.json` metadata, and every data table. Binary media (images,
   `.docx`, the article `.pdf` — every version ships JATS `.xml`, so the PDF is redundant) are skipped.
   `fetch_pmc_tables` remains as a thin wrapper returning only the table files.

The main text and every candidate table are wired into the agent TWICE, deliberately: the supervisor
pre-renders the `pmc_article_context` summary (JATS title/abstract/outline/supplementary manifest) and
a head preview of **every** qualifying candidate table **and every qualifying Excel worksheet** directly into the task text
(`render_task_context`), so the agent can author a config with **zero inspection tool calls**. The
`pmc_article_context` / `read_table` tools stay registered as fallbacks for rows beyond a preview (for
Excel, `read_table` lists **all worksheets** and reads a chosen one via `sheet=` (set `source.sheet`
in the config). Small tables and worksheets are filtered before this context is rendered; see
[Small-table guard](#small-table-guard).

!!! failure "The old paths are dead"
    The legacy `s3://pmc-open-access` bucket, the FTP `oa_file_list.csv`, and the per-article `tar.gz`
    bundles were **deprecated and removed (Aug 2026)**. The PMC website `/bin/` URLs are unreliable
    (404/HTML stubs) and batch-scraping the website is prohibited. Use the S3 bucket only.

!!! note "Coverage + licensing"
    Only the **open-access subset** of PMC (~half) is available here. Articles are **CC-BY**: cite the
    source and DOI (e.g. PMC11708054 → [10.1128/mbio.01679-24](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01679-24)).

### Local payloads (non-open-access articles)

Only the open-access subset of PMC is fetchable from the bucket. To run the **same** derive/build/improve
pipeline on an article you already hold locally (e.g. a non-open-access paper), pass `--local`:

```bash
# one directory used for every PMC id
tablassert agent PMC11708054 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml --local ./payloads/PMC11708054

# per-article directories
tablassert agent PMC1 PMC2 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml --local PMC1=./payloads/p1 PMC2=./payloads/p2
```

A local payload directory holds the table(s) and (optionally) the article main text. When `--local` is
given for an id, the supervisor locates the files there and **does not fetch from PMC-AWS**; each section's
`source.local` points at the local file (set `source.url` to the original download link if you want the
config to be re-fetchable). A `--local` directory that does not exist fails loud (exit 2).

## Model configuration

The agent talks to an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint (e.g. a Qwen endpoint). Configuration comes from
CLI flags **and** environment variables: **secrets are never hardcoded**, and the command **fails
loudly** if any required value is unset.

| Flag | Env var | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--model-id`, `-m` | `TABLASSERT_AGENT_MODEL_ID` | model identifier |
| `--api-base`, `-ab` | `TABLASSERT_AGENT_API_BASE` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `--api-key`, `-ak` | `TABLASSERT_AGENT_API_KEY` | API key (secret) |
| `--backend`, `-b` | n/a | `openai` (default) or `litellm` |

```bash
export TABLASSERT_AGENT_MODEL_ID="qwen3-max"
export TABLASSERT_AGENT_API_BASE="https://YOUR-ENDPOINT.example.com/v1"   # placeholder
export TABLASSERT_AGENT_API_KEY="sk-***"                                  # placeholder: never commit a real key
```

If a value is missing, `tablassert agent` prints a message naming the exact flag/env var and exits
non-zero **before** any model call.

## Running it for real

With network access and a configured endpoint:

```bash
tablassert agent PMC11708054 PMC12345678 \
  --configuration-file ./graph.yaml \
  --map-threshold 0.25 \
  --max-improve-iters 3 \
  --max-steps 20 \
  --min-rows 50 \
  --state-dir .tablassert/agent
```

The required target is `--configuration-file`/`-f`; it supplies the fullmap, graph identity, RIG,
artifact metadata, and existing table list. Flags: `--max-steps`/`-ms`, `--min-rows`/`-mr`,
`--map-threshold`/`-mt`, `--max-improve-iters`/`-mi`, `--state-dir`/`-sd`, `--backend {openai,litellm}`/`-b`, plus `--local`/`-l`, `--reflexion`,
`--judge-model`, `--judge-threshold`, `--biolink-threshold`, and the `--optimize`/`-o` prompt-optimization flags
(`--instructions-file`, `--instructions-out`, `--max-metric-calls`, `--dataset`).
The [CLI reference: `agent`](cli.md#agent) is the authoritative flag table; the list here is a compact
reminder.

### Small-table guard

The agent's default small-table guard is **50 non-empty data rows** (`--min-rows 50` or `-mr 50`).
The count follows the same polars parsing used by the pipeline: the header is not counted, quoted
embedded newlines remain part of one row, and rows blank across every column do not count. It applies
to both delimited files (`.csv`/`.tsv`) and Excel worksheets (`.xlsx`/`.xls`). Set `--min-rows 0`
to disable the guard; negative values fail before the agent starts.

The supervisor applies the guard after a payload is downloaded or located locally and **before it
constructs the LLM agent**. A delimited file below the threshold is removed from the candidate list.
A workbook remains available when at least one worksheet qualifies, but small worksheets are omitted
from previews and explicitly listed as excluded; the preview cap is spent only on qualifying sheets.
Unreadable files are retained fail-open so the existing `read_table` fallback can report the concrete
parse error instead of silently dropping a file. If every readable table is too small, the supervisor
records an actionable `SKIPPED` reason (including the observed row counts) without constructing a
model or running a build. The runtime task then names the qualifying sheets to focus on and instructs
the agent not to author sections for excluded sheets.

### What the supervisor does

The **outer supervisor is deterministic Python** (not an LLM); smolagents' #1 practice is deterministic
control flow over agentic decisions. For each PMC id it:

1. **Fetches** the latest-version article payload (`fetch_pmc_article`: main text + metadata + all tables;
   fails fast on not-open-access / no-table), filters out below-threshold tables and worksheets, and
   presents only qualifying candidates to the agent. If no readable candidate qualifies, it records
   `SKIPPED` before constructing the inner model.
2. Runs the **inner `CodeAgent`** to *derive* an initial table config (the task already contains the
   article summary + head previews of every table/worksheet, so the typical path is just `derive_config`;
   `pmc_article_context` / `read_table` remain fallbacks; every section gated by the Section JSON
   schema). The agent maps **each** mappable table/worksheet as its own section, **one config per paper**
   (see below).
3. **Builds + audits** in one deterministic mega-tool (`build_and_audit`: validate → build → QC → coverage
   → **Biolink validity**). The report is *actionable*, not just a score: a nonzero `demoted_edge_pct`
   comes with `predicate_advice` (the legal predicates for the demoted category pair), unresolved terms
   that still contain a separator surface as `multivalued_suspects` (a missed `explode_by`), and every
   report carries a `head` fidelity flag so sampled edge counts are never compared against full builds.
4. **Improves** while coverage `< map_threshold` and budget remains: `propose_config_edit` → rebuild →
   **accept iff no worse on coverage *or* Biolink validity and strictly better on one** (monotonic:
   regressions on either axis are rejected, so a coverage win can no longer be bought with invalid KGX) —
   and an edit that shrinks the full-build **edge count** by more than 25% is rejected even with a gain
   (the detail-first objective: the biggest solid config wins). The deterministic proposer now covers
   **four** knob families: NodeEncoding knobs (`prioritize`/`avoid`/`regex`/`remove`/`exclude_*`),
   **`explode_by`** (added when unresolved terms still carry a separator), and — fed the audit report —
   a **demoted-predicate fix** (the first legal predicate from `predicate_advice`); tier-2 LLM reflexion
   may additionally change qualifiers, `split_by`, node categories, and the source.
5. **Records** metrics, **checkpoints**, and moves to the next config.

A config that won't map after `--max-improve-iters` is marked `SKIPPED: <reason>` and the supervisor
advances: one difficult article never aborts the batch. A config that **builds** but whose fullmap
coverage **cannot be measured** (an unreproducible source frame) is marked `BUILT_UNMEASURED`, a
terminal **non-failure** that is neither a certified `MAPPED` nor counted as a `SKIPPED`; the best
config is still written and is reusable by the full pipeline. Coverage measurement itself is
multi-cwd: a relative `source.local` is resolved against the build workdir as well as the current
directory before a config is declared unmeasurable.

### Optional gates: reflexion improver & semantic judge

Two opt-in extensions layer on top of the deterministic improve loop (both reuse the configured
endpoint; neither is required):

- **`--reflexion`**: when the deterministic `propose_config_edit` stalls, a tier-2 LLM reflexion
  improver reflects on the coverage feedback and proposes an edit that may change predicate/source
  (same model config).
- **`--judge-model` / `--judge-threshold`**: a semantic judge scores the built output; when
  `--judge-model` is set, `MAPPED` additionally requires the normalized score to clear
  `--judge-threshold` (`0.5` when unset). Without `--judge-model` the coverage gate alone decides.
- **`--biolink-threshold`**: `MAPPED` additionally requires the built KGX's Biolink pass rate to
  clear it. Defaults to `0.0` (report only): the rate is always measured and recorded, and raising
  the threshold turns that measurement into a terminal gate. See
  [Biolink validity](#biolink-validity) below.

### Biolink validity

Coverage answers *did the terms resolve?* It says nothing about whether the resulting records are
consumable. The agent therefore validates **its own output**: after each build, `build_and_audit`
constructs every emitted node and edge as the Biolink Pydantic class named by its own `category`,
the same check [`tablassert validate-kgx`](cli.md#validate-kgx) runs, and the same classes
`translator-ingests` builds. Six fields land in the audit report:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `biolink_valid_pct` | Pass rate excluding known-pending fields. **This is the scored number.** |
| `biolink_valid_pct_strict` | Pass rate with no exemptions, so the pending gap stays visible |
| `biolink_problems` | Top `"field: error-type"` failures with counts, for self-correction |
| `demoted_edge_pct` | Fraction of edges that fell back to bare `biolink:Association` |
| `predicate_advice` | Per demoted (predicate, subject, object) group: the derived association class and the **legal predicates** — the exact fix, not just the symptom |
| `multivalued_suspects` | Entity columns whose unresolved terms still contain a separator (`;`, `\|`, `,`) — a missed `explode_by`, with the literal separator to declare |

**`demoted_edge_pct` is the predicate signal.** Tablassert derives an edge's association class from
the (subject category, object category) pair, then `resolve_association_class` gives up as much of
that class as the predicate requires. A predicate the class forbids is **never an error**: it
silently demotes the edge and discards every qualifier and evidence slot that class declared. So
`gene_associated_with_condition` on a gene~disease table builds cleanly, maps perfectly, and produces
`biolink:Association` edges. `predicate_advice` turns that signal into a fix, and the deterministic
proposer applies it automatically when handed the audit report.

The prompt now carries a **generated legal-predicate table** for the category pairs the agent meets in
practice, rendered at import from the installed `biolink-model` (via `lib.predicate_options`) so it
cannot drift from the model the build validates against:

```text
- Gene ~ Disease -> GeneToDiseaseAssociation: affects, associated_with, contributes_to
- SequenceVariant ~ Gene -> VariantToGeneAssociation: condition_associated_with_gene, …
- any predicate is safe for: Gene~Gene, Gene~Pathway, ChemicalEntity~Disease, …
```

- An annotation like `supporting_study_size` or `sample_size` names study-level metadata.
  biolink-model 4.4.4 ([PR #1770](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/pull/1770))
  deprecated the old `supporting_study_*` association slots and replaced them with `Study`
  node properties, so the value is carried on the edge's inlined supporting `Study` (as
  `study_size`, `study_cohort`, and related fields) rather than emitted on the edge.
  `relationship_strength` is not one of these. It is a legacy alias coerced to the real edge
  slot `effect_size`. Names that are not association slots at all (`fold_change` alone,
  `z_score`, and similar names) are folded into `supporting_text`. Authoring any relocated
  name emits a `BiolinkRelocationWarning` naming where the value actually went, a warning,
  not an error: nothing is lost, and every existing config keeps building.
- Enum-ranged qualifiers take a literal token (`object_direction_qualifier: increased`), never a
  CURIE, and are deliberately **not** entity-resolved. `map_coverage` skips them for the same reason
  the build does, so they no longer depress a config's coverage score for working correctly.

### Multi-section configs (one per paper)

The agent authors **one table config per paper** that may contain **multiple sections**, one per
mappable supplementary table/worksheet. The config is shaped as `{template, sections}`:

- **`template`** carries the shared per-paper **provenance** (`repo` + `publication`) and nothing else:
  in particular **no `source`**.
- **`sections`** is a list with one entry per table; **each section owns its own `source`** (its own
  `local` path **and** its own `source.url` download link, plus `sheet`/`row_slice`/`delimiter` as
  needed) and its own `statement`. Different sections can therefore reference **different files with
  different download links**.

The final-answer gate (`validate_table_config`) validates **every** section, so a config is accepted
only when all of its sections are schema-valid. `map_coverage` measures each section and reports an
**aggregate** (`overall` = mean of section coverages, `min` = weakest section, `measured` = true iff
every section measured, plus the per-section breakdown under `sections`). `propose_config_edit` edits
each section independently from its own coverage entry. A single-table paper is still one config with
one section. State and storage stay **per-paper**: one best config (`configs/<pmc_id>.yaml`) holding
all sections, with `section_coverages` recorded for visibility.

### Workspace layout, target graph, and checkpoint / rerun

`--configuration-file` is the caller-owned Graph YAML that the agent updates in place. Its `fullmap`,
`name`, `version`, complete `rig:`, and artifact metadata drive every one-table audit. The agent does
**not** create an aggregate graph under `state_dir`; `state_dir` remains only the checkpoint and working
artifact directory (default `.tablassert/agent`, override with `--state-dir`):

```text
project/graph.yaml                       # caller-owned aggregate graph, updated in place
.tablassert/agent/                       # checkpoint/artifact workspace
  state.json                             # supervisor checkpoint (atomic)
  configs/<pmc_id>.yaml                  # accepted generated table config (absolute source.local)
  configs/<pmc_id>.derived.yaml          # initial generated config
  downloads/<pmc_id>/<prefix>/...        # fetched PMC payload; stable across runs
  builds/<pmc_id>/table.yaml             # temporary one-table audit input
  builds/<pmc_id>/artifacts/             # <graph-name>_<graph-version>.{nodes,edges}.ndjson + RIG
  builds/<pmc_id>/.tablassert/store/      # temporary parquet cache
```

Only newly generated agent table configs are normalized: every section's `source.local` is written as
an absolute local/data-lake path, and the graph's new `tables` entry is an absolute path. Existing
user-authored table YAMLs and their source paths are not rewritten. The target graph's existing metadata
and unrelated table entries are preserved.

A result is appended to the target graph only when it is `MAPPED` or `BUILT_UNMEASURED`. `SKIPPED`
articles never append. If the same PMC is processed again, its old table entry is replaced and the new
absolute config path is appended. Requested PMCs are deliberately processed again even when `state.json`
contains a terminal record; this makes reruns effective while retaining attempts, coverage history, and
metrics. A failed rerun does not replace the prior successful config.

The agent audits each candidate with a one-table in-process graph, so it does not rebuild every table
already present in the target graph. The temporary audit inherits the target graph's semantic metadata
and graph identity but writes physical artifacts to an isolated per-article workspace. Build the complete
aggregate explicitly after the agent finishes:

```bash
tablassert agent PMC11708054 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml --state-dir .tablassert/agent
# inspect graph.yaml, then build every existing + generated table together
tablassert build-kg -f ./graph.yaml
```

!!! warning "Absolute paths are intentional"
    Generated `tables` entries and generated `source.local` values are absolute so the target graph can
    be built from any current working directory. Moving the data lake, downloaded payload, or workspace
    requires updating those generated paths or rerunning the agent.

### Concurrent agents targeting one graph

Several agent processes may target the same caller-owned graph. Each successful append takes an exclusive
`<graph>.lock` sidecar lock and atomically replaces the graph YAML, so distinct PMCs do not lose one
another's entries and a same-PMC rerun has deterministic last-writer-wins replacement. The checkpoint
`state.json` read-modify-write is still per-workspace and is not cross-process locked; use separate
`state_dir` values for concurrent processes unless they intentionally coordinate their article ids.

## The tools

| Tool | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fetch_pmc_article` | function | PMC-AWS download of the useful latest-version payload (main text + metadata + tables), fail-fast |
| `pmc_article_context` | tool | parse the JATS main text into a **data-fenced** summary (title/abstract/sections/supplementary manifest); `.txt` renders a fenced excerpt |
| `read_table` | tool | render a table as **data-fenced, spotlighted** text; lists **all worksheets** of an Excel file (`sheet=`) |
| `derive_config` | tool | author a table config (`template` + one section per table); each section must satisfy `Section.model_json_schema()` |
| `build_and_audit` | tool | **one** deterministic validate→build→QC→coverage→**Biolink-validity** mega-tool; the report's `predicate_advice` / `multivalued_suspects` fields make demotions and missed `explode_by`s directly actionable |
| `map_coverage` | tool | fullmap term-resolution coverage (per-column + overall) |
| `propose_config_edit` | tool | deterministic, constrained edits + rationale: `NodeEncoding` knobs, `explode_by` from separator-carrying unresolved terms, and (given the audit report) a demoted-predicate fix |

`build_and_audit` returns coded errors **verbatim** (each carries a docs URL) so the agent can
self-correct the exact offending field. `derive_config` does the same: a candidate config that fails
the Section schema comes back as its coded error instead of being forwarded, because the final-answer
gate can only answer true/false and would otherwise swallow the reason.

## Prompt engineering

The agent's `instructions` make the techniques explicit:

- **Detail-first goal ordering**: the goals are (1) BREADTH + DETAIL — every mappable sheet as its own
  section, every evidence slot captured, multi-valued cells exploded, direction/aspect columns
  qualified; (2) coverage; (3) Biolink validity / QC; (4) efficiency LAST — the prompt states plainly
  that a mappable sheet or evidence column is never sacrificed to save a tool call.
- **ReAct, planning off**: `CodeAgent` is a ReAct loop, but periodic re-planning is disabled
  (`planning_interval=None`): each planning turn is a whole extra LLM round trip carrying the full
  prompt, and the task already prescribes a fixed short workflow (derive → build → optional edit →
  answer). The prompt caps in-agent improve rounds at two; the supervisor's deterministic improve loop
  continues after the agent finishes.
- **Structured / constrained output**: `derive_config` injects the Section JSON schema; a
  `final_answer_checks=[validate_table_config]` gate means the agent can only terminate with a config
  whose **every section** is schema-valid (multi-section configs are validated section-by-section).
- **A regex cookbook**: the prompt teaches the actual semantics agents get wrong — Rust-regex
  substitutions (no backreferences, no lookarounds), single-quoted YAML so backslashes stay literal,
  `regex` vs `remove` vs `exclude_regex`, and that CURIEs come from resolution or `prefix`/`suffix`,
  never from capture groups.
- **Positive qualifier guidance**: direction/aspect columns map to `object_direction_qualifier` /
  `object_aspect_qualifier` (`method: column` + `nullable: true` for blanks); enum-ranged qualifiers
  take literal tokens; `qualified_predicate: biolink:causes` is the one CURIE-taking exception;
  `species_context_qualifier` stays banned.
- **Predicate specificity**: pick the most-specific predicate the derived association class permits,
  chosen from the generated legal-predicate table — never a generic default and never a predicate the
  class forbids; `predicate_advice` in the audit report names the exact fix when demotion happens.
- **Few-shot exemplars**: the tutorial gene~disease section, the ALAMV6 organism~chemical section, a
  multi-section config (one config, two tables, each section its own source/url), and a **rich
  exemplar** combining `explode_by: ";"`, a column qualifier, a regex strip, and the paired
  `effect_size`/`effect_type` annotations — every exemplar's predicate is a legal, specific choice for
  its category pair (guarded by tests).
- **Reflexion-style self-critique**: `propose_config_edit` / `reflexion_improve` reflect on failing rows,
  error codes, and unresolved terms, then make a targeted, schema-valid edit.
- **Error-recovery prompting**: tools return rich coded errors; the prompt directs the agent to read the
  code + message and fix precisely that field, never repeating an unchanged config.
- **Context trimming**: a `step_callback` tallies tokens/steps and failed/wrong/redundant tool calls, and
  trims large old observations to save tokens.

### Prompt-injection defenses

PMC article text and tables are **untrusted data**. Defenses:

- **Data-fence + spotlighting**: `read_table` wraps content in `<<<PMC_DATA_BEGIN>>>` /
  `<<<PMC_DATA_END>>>` preceded by a guardrail; the instructions state that fenced content is DATA, never
  instructions, and any embedded commands are ignored.
- **Minimal authorized imports**: the executor allowlist is exactly `["yaml"]`, so a hijacked agent cannot
  `import os`/`subprocess`.

## Evaluation & optimization loop

The harness scores every run on three objectives and optimizes them as a black box.

**Deterministic metrics (gate the loop):**

- **Quality**: fullmap mapping coverage (0.40), **Biolink pass rate** (0.25), KG node/edge **F1** vs
  the reference graph (0.15), QC audit pass rate (0.10), and config schema validity (0.10, and a hard
  gate: an invalid config scores 0).
- **Cost**: `RunResult.token_usage` + step count (the API is free; tokens are the proxy).
- **Reliability**: failed / wrong / redundant tool-call counts from the `ActionStep` logs.

**LLM-as-judge (semantic dimensions only):** a pointwise **0–3** rubric over schema validity, coverage,
**Biolink validity**, QC pass, predicate/category appropriateness, provenance completeness, efficiency,
and tool-call cleanliness, with **position** (both orderings averaged) and **verbosity** bias mitigation. Deterministic
metrics gate the rest; the judge only scores what a metric cannot. Without a judge model, an offline
deterministic heuristic is used.

**Optimizers:**

- **Reflexion**: the simple first-increment retry (`reflexion_improve`).
- **GEPA**: `dspy.GEPA(metric=gepa_metric, candidate_selection_strategy="pareto", …)` optimizes the
  agent's `instructions` + tool `description`s + exemplars as a **black box** from textual feedback
  (`gepa_metric` returns `dspy.Prediction(score=weighted_quality, feedback="<failing rows + error codes +
  Biolink problems + demoted-edge fraction + the legal predicates from predicate_advice + missed
  explode_by suspects + wrong-call list>")`). It is system-agnostic, Pareto-native, and needs few rollouts.

**Reporting:** `pareto_frontier(runs)` returns the **non-dominated set** over (quality ↑, cost ↓,
wrong-calls ↓) and its **knee** (best quality per unit cost).

### Real-run prompt optimization (`--optimize`)

GEPA prompt optimization is a first-class CLI path. `tablassert agent --optimize` (`-o`) runs
`dspy.GEPA` and **persists the optimized instructions** instead of running the supervisor.

Following GEPA best practice, the optimizer splits the models: a **strong reflection LM** (`--model-id`)
proposes the few instruction edits, and an optional **fast task LM** (`--task-model`) runs the many
candidate program evaluations. Pointing `--task-model` at a cheap model (e.g. a flash model) keeps the
run fast while the strong model does the thinking; without `--task-model` the reflection LM is used for
both. `--gepa-threads` parallelizes GEPA's candidate **LM forward passes** only: the coverage-scoring
builds stay serialized on the process-wide `_GEPA_BUILD_LOCK` (`agent.py`, since `os.chdir` is
process-global), so a higher thread count does not speed up the expensive build/coverage step.

```bash
# optimize the agent prompt over a dataset of examples, writing the result to a file
tablassert agent PMC11708054 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml --optimize \
  --dataset examples/gepa-dataset.yaml --task-model qwen-flash \
  --max-metric-calls 30 --gepa-threads 4 \
  --instructions-out .tablassert/agent/optimized_instructions.yaml

# later, run the supervisor with the optimized prompt
tablassert agent PMC11708054 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml \
  --instructions-file .tablassert/agent/optimized_instructions.yaml
```

`--dataset` is a YAML/JSON list of examples. Each example carries `table_summary` and
`coverage_feedback` (the program inputs); it MAY also carry:

- `fullmap`: a fullmap path. When present, the GEPA metric scores each proposed config with **real
  fullmap coverage** (via a `build_and_audit` head-sample), so GEPA optimizes the genuine objective
  rather than a validity-only proxy.
- `workdir`: the directory a proposed config's relative `source.local` resolves against (LLMs mimic the
  exemplar's `./downloads/...` paths), so coverage is measured on the actual table.
- `head`: defaults to `true`, which scores a fast 5-row preview; set `false` for full-fidelity coverage builds.

`--max-metric-calls` bounds the GEPA metric budget. `save_optimized_instructions` /
`load_optimized_instructions` persist and reload the prompt (a `{instructions, descriptions}` mapping).
Without `--instructions-file` the built-in `INSTRUCTIONS` prompt is used. The committed
`examples/agent/optimized_instructions.yaml` is a GEPA **artifact** from an older seed — do not hand-edit
it; rerun `--optimize` so GEPA starts from the current (detail-first) seed prompt instead. (A real
optimization run needs a live model; the offline suite exercises this path via an injectable `gepa_cls`
stub.)

### Golden fixture

`tests/agent_fixtures/PMC11708054/` is an offline replay pair: the ALAMV6 reference config, a small
**synthetic** source table, and a trimmed reference config (CC-BY attribution to PMC11708054; the
reference KGX is computed in-test against a tiny real redb; nothing large is committed). A second
fixture, `tests/agent_fixtures/GENE_DISEASE/`, is a gene~disease config in multi-section
(`{template, sections}`) shape with PMID provenance, used to keep the offline heuristic judge and the
W3 multi-section validation honest on a distinct config.

## Edge-count acceptance (agent vs reference)

An agent-produced config is only as good as the graph it emits. The acceptance gate is an **edge-count
fraction**: built over the SAME payload against the SAME fullmap, the agent config must emit at least
half the KGX edges of a richer hand-curated reference config: `agent_edges >= 0.5 * reference_edges`
(`REFERENCE_EDGE_FRACTION` in `tests/test_agent_edgecount.py`). A config that reads only one sheet, or
that skips `explode_by` on a multi-valued column, silently emits far fewer edges; this gate catches it.

**Offline harness (committed fixtures):** `tests/fixtures/edgecount/` ships a synthetic
PMC10766526-shaped disease x system workbook plus three configs: the improved-agent shape
(multi-section, correct `sheet` + `row_slice`, `explode_by`/`prioritize` breadth, paired
`effect_size` + `effect_type` annotations), a strictly richer reference (all three sheets), and an
intentionally-impoverished single-section no-`explode_by` negative control that MUST fail the gate:

```bash
uv run --extra qc --extra agent pytest tests/test_agent_edgecount.py -q
```

**Real runbook (PMC10766526):** run the agent over the downloaded payload, build one-table graphs
for the agent config and the already-converted v12 reference config, and compare the
`<name>_<version>.edges.ndjson` line counts from `rig.artifact_base_path`:

```bash
# 1. Run the agent OFFLINE against a local payload (no PMC-AWS fetch)
tablassert agent PMC10766526 --configuration-file ./graph.yaml \
  --local PMC10766526=./downloads/PMC10766526
# accepted config: .tablassert/agent/configs/PMC10766526.yaml

# 2. Build each as a one-table graph (same fullmap, same graph name/version conventions)
tablassert build-kg -f ./agent_graph.yaml       # tables: [.tablassert/agent/configs/PMC10766526.yaml]
tablassert build-kg -f ./reference_graph.yaml   # tables: [./legacy/PMC10766526.v12.yaml]

# 3. Count edges; acceptance: agent >= 0.5 * reference
wc -l <agent-graph-name>_<version>.edges.ndjson <reference-graph-name>_<version>.edges.ndjson
```

The same comparison is scriptable via the env-gated test: set `TABLASSERT_PMC_COMPARE` to a JSON
array of four paths: the agent config, the reference config, the payload, and the fullmap redb.
A JSON array (not a colon-separated string) keeps POSIX paths containing `:` and Windows
drive-letter paths working. The `<agent-config>` and `<reference-config>` may carry relative
`source.local` paths; both are rebuilt over `<payload>`:

```bash
TABLASSERT_PMC_COMPARE='[".tablassert/agent/configs/PMC10766526.yaml", "./legacy/PMC10766526.v12.yaml", "./downloads/PMC10766526/PMC10766526.1/table.xlsx", "data/fullmap.redb"]' \
  uv run --extra qc --extra agent pytest tests/test_agent_edgecount.py::test_real_pmc_comparison -q
```

Unset, that test skips with a printed reason; the offline fixture tests run regardless.

## Testing

The agent suite is **fully offline**: no live LLM or network. It uses a `FakeModel` smolagents stub,
mocked/snapshotted PMC data, a tiny real redb (`rs.build_fullmap_db`), and injectable GEPA stubs.

```bash
# Agent tests SKIP without the extra and PASS with it:
uv sync --extra agent
uv run pytest -q tests/test_agent_eval.py tests/test_agent_supervisor.py tests/test_agent_assembly.py
```

Without the extra, the base suite stays green and every agent test skips via `pytest.importorskip`.

!!! tip "Telemetry"
    A real `CodeAgent.run` emits HuggingFace telemetry that blocks on a network call. The agent tests set
    `HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` / `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` to stay hermetically offline; set the same when running
    fully air-gapped.
