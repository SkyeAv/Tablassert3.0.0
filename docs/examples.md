**Turn real tabular sources — CSV, TSV, or Excel — into KGX-compliant nodes and edges.** Each pattern
below leads with the data type and the outcome it produces, then gives a complete, schema-valid
configuration and the techniques that make it work.

## Gene-Disease Associations

Transform a **CSV** of gene-disease associations into KGX-compliant edges with statistical annotations.

**Data:** CSV with gene symbols, disease names, and p-values

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: text
    local: ./gene-disease.csv
    url: https://example.com/gene-disease.csv
    row_slice: [1, auto]
    delimiter: ","
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      prioritize: [Gene]
      taxon: 9606
    predicate: associated_with
    object:
      method: column
      encoding: B
      prioritize: [Disease]
  provenance:
    repo: PMID
    publication: "12345678"
  annotations:
    - annotation: p_value
      method: column
      encoding: C
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Taxonomic filtering** (`taxon: 9606`) restricts gene resolution to human genes; **category prioritization** resolves genes as `biolink:Gene` and diseases as `biolink:Disease`.
- **Column annotations** attach per-row p-values to each edge (Excel column letters `A`/`B`/`C` reference headerless columns).

## Drug-Target Interactions

Extract drug-target relationships from a curated **TSV** interaction database into KGX edges tagged with
interaction type and assay.

**Data:** TSV with drug names, target genes, and interaction types

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: text
    local: ./drug-targets.tsv
    url: https://example.com/drug-targets.tsv
    row_slice: [1, auto]
    delimiter: "\t"
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      prioritize: [ChemicalEntity, SmallMolecule]
    predicate: interacts_with
    object:
      method: column
      encoding: B
      prioritize: [Gene, Protein]
      taxon: 9606
  provenance:
    repo: PMID
    publication: "98765432"
  annotations:
    - annotation: interaction_type
      method: column
      encoding: C
    - annotation: assay
      method: value
      encoding: "binding assay"
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Multiple prioritized categories** (`ChemicalEntity`, `SmallMolecule`) give entity resolution fallback options.
- **Fixed-value annotation** (`method: value`) attaches the same assay description to all edges; `delimiter: "\t"` handles tab-separated files.

## Microbiome-Metabolite Correlations

Turn an **Excel** sheet of microbe-metabolite correlations into KGX edges, cleaning raw taxonomic names
with a regex pipeline on the way.

**Data:** Excel with raw taxonomic names, correlation coefficients, and p-values

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: excel
    local: ./microbiome-correlations.xlsx
    url: https://example.com/microbiome-data.xlsx
    sheet: correlations
    row_slice: [2, auto]
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      prioritize: [OrganismTaxon]
      avoid: [Gene]
      remove: ["^NA "]
      regex:
        - {pattern: ".*g__", replacement: ""}
        - {pattern: ";s__", replacement: " "}
        - {pattern: "sp", replacement: "sp. "}
    predicate: correlated_with
    object:
      method: value
      encoding: CHEBI:41774
  provenance:
    repo: PMC
    publication: PMC11708054
  annotations:
    - annotation: p_value
      method: column
      encoding: C
    - annotation: effect_size
      method: column
      encoding: B
    - annotation: effect_type
      method: value
      encoding: spearmans_rho
    - annotation: assertion_method
      method: value
      encoding: "Spearman correlation"
    # Freetext catch-all for context that doesn't fit a structured field.
    - annotation: miscellaneous_notes
      method: value
      encoding: "FDR-corrected; samples pooled across two cohorts"
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Regex pipeline** cleans raw taxonomic strings (`d__Bacteria;p__Firmicutes;g__Lactobacillus` → `Lactobacillus`). Patterns must be Polars `str.replace_all()`-compatible (Rust `regex` engine) — no backreferences (`\1`, `\2`, …) or lookarounds (`(?=...)`, `(?<=...)`, `(?!...)`, `(?<!...)`); plain and non-capturing groups are supported, so chain several simple substitutions when needed.
- **Avoid list** (`avoid: [Gene]`) prevents organism names resolving to gene entities; **fixed-value object** (`method: value`) assigns the same metabolite CURIE to all rows.

## Multi-Pathway Gene Mapping

Map genes from a single **CSV** to multiple pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome) in one pass using
template + sections.

**Data:** CSV with gene symbols and multiple pathway columns

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: text
    local: ./gene-pathways.csv
    url: https://example.com/gene-pathways.csv
    row_slice: [1, auto]
    delimiter: ","
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      prioritize: [Gene]
      taxon: 9606
    object:
      method: value
      encoding: PLACEHOLDER
  provenance:
    repo: PMID
    publication: "11223344"

sections:
  - statement:
      predicate: participates_in
      object:
        method: column
        encoding: B
        prioritize: [Pathway]
    annotations:
      - annotation: pathway_database
        method: value
        encoding: "KEGG"

  - statement:
      predicate: participates_in
      object:
        method: column
        encoding: C
        prioritize: [Pathway]
    annotations:
      - annotation: pathway_database
        method: value
        encoding: "Reactome"
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Template + sections** avoids repeating source and provenance for each pathway column — each section provides its own predicate and object while inheriting the shared subject and source.
- **Per-section annotations** tag edges with the pathway database source.

## Conditional Filtering with Reindex

Filter a **CSV** of gene-disease associations down to significant, well-powered rows before building KGX
edges (reindex on column values).

**Data:** CSV with gene-disease associations and significance thresholds

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: text
    local: ./significant-associations.csv
    url: https://example.com/associations.csv
    row_slice: [1, auto]
    delimiter: ","
    reindex:
      - {column: C, comparison: lt, comparator: 0.05}
      - {column: D, comparison: ge, comparator: 100}
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      prioritize: [Gene]
      taxon: 9606
    predicate: associated_with
    object:
      method: column
      encoding: B
      prioritize: [Disease]
  provenance:
    repo: PMID
    publication: "55667788"
  annotations:
    - annotation: p_value
      method: column
      encoding: C
    - annotation: supporting_study_size
      method: column
      encoding: D
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Reindex filtering** keeps only rows where column C (p-value) < 0.05 AND column D (sample size) >= 100; multiple reindex conditions are ANDed together.
- **Comparison operators** — `lt` (less than), `ge` (greater or equal), `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `le`.

## Null Handling with Forward Fill

Build `subclass_of` edges from a hierarchical **CSV** where parent categories propagate down through
empty cells (forward fill).

**Data:** CSV with category headers followed by subcategory rows (gaps in category column)

```yaml
template:
  source:
    kind: text
    local: ./hierarchical-data.csv
    url: https://example.com/hierarchical.csv
    row_slice: [1, auto]
    delimiter: ","
  statement:
    subject:
      method: column
      encoding: A
      fill: forward
      prioritize: [ChemicalEntity]
    predicate: subclass_of
    object:
      method: column
      encoding: B
      prioritize: [ChemicalEntity]
  provenance:
    repo: PMID
    publication: "99887766"
```

**Key techniques:**

- **Forward fill** (`fill: forward`) propagates the last non-null value downward, mapping subcategory rows to their parent category.
- **Other fill strategies** — `backward`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, `zero`, `one`.
