"""The optional-extra registry: detection, messages, and the guarantee that it matches pyproject.

Every test here runs in the BASE environment. The registry is the single place that answers
"which extra ships this package, and what do I type to install it", so the tests pin BOTH halves:
the mapping stays in sync with ``pyproject.toml`` (it silently misdirects users otherwise), and
every failure carries a copy-pasteable install command.
